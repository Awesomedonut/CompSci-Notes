## 1: Images and Colours

# Intro to MATLAB

many diff and useful tools for img processing and comp vision, used for diff purposes
ex: fast, real time app -> C++ solution
deep learning, img processing -> python (many DL frameworks use python)

why MATLAB?
usefl for lin alg, espec for huge matrices and complex lin alg solutions
very convinient and easy for quickstarts
doesnt require other installations

(aside: openCV exists. open comp vision library, covers most stuff u can do w MATLAB)

important: select a coding environment and make it ur home

MATLAB -> glorified calculator

How we look at images in MATLAB (and digitally in general)

colour images
what colour is
how we can represent colour ditigally

alpha channels and compositing
alpha channels: how we represent transparancey in images
